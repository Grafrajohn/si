<h2>The Simpris advantage</h2>
<p>Imagine your teams – production, marketing, creative, quality control, product launch – all working together in a unified web based project management system they all understand. Staff are quickly able to navigate to find what they want – no complicated jargon or procedures to learn. Each project and its tasks can be reviewed to spot hold-ups, delays and overspends. You are in control – you can manage your work!</p>
<p>Simpris has all the features required by modern project and program managers. It can be used to priotitise work, schedule work, and quickly reallocate work where necessary.</p>

<p>Simpris is the result of years of careful thinking about how people organise their work - their projects and tasks. And how people use their time.</p>
<h2>Choose your project methodology</h2>
Different projects require different approaches. Simpris can adapt to your chosen project methodology, and many of the advantages of those methodologies are baked into Simpris as features. Divide your project into phases, appoint stakeholders, bring visibility to groups of tasks. Work fast and agile with sprints of work, or work to a pre-organised and structured plan with the tried and trusted waterfall technique.

Work Hard, Work Smart.
Simpris has a Kanban board with which your staff can organise their work as it progresses. There is a Gantt chart too to view the committment of resources on various projects. Finally a calendar allows the project and task schedules to be viewed in time. Project managers can see where their resources are committed, and where they need to move resources.

Being a web based project management system, Simpris is available to all of your staff. If they have a computer with a browser they can contribute.

Sometimes an organisation will have a program which consists of various projects. Simpris has you covered here. Programs can be managed and tracked by senior management. Simpris allows you to have an overview of your projects and programs - it does not bury you in detail.

<h3>Project Management</h3>
In Simpris tasks are organised into tasklists which are organised into projects, so you can always get an overview of your projects and what is in them. You will never feel that you have lost control, or that you don't know what is going on.

Simpris can track the time spent on every task in your projects. You can see how much time is being spent and where.

Simpris allows you to record and log problems as you manage your projects and tasks.
