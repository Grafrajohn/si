Goodly Code Limited ("Simpris") operates several websites including Simpris.com and related
subdomains. It is Simpris's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Simpris collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Simpris's purpose in collecting nonpersonally identifying information is to better understand how Simpris's visitors use its website and
to better provide related content to its visitors. From time to time, Simpris may release nonpersonally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
usage of its website.

Simpris also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Name, Organization or
Company, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Simpris only discloses logged in user
IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
information as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Simpris's websites choose to interact with Simpris in ways that require Simpris to
gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Simpris gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at
Simpris.com to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Simpris -
by purchasing access to the Simpris paid service, for example - are asked to provide additional
information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those
transactions. In each case, Simpris collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Simpris.

Note that Simpris does not collect or retain any information directly from credit cards other than
subscriber name, instead such information is retained by FASTSPRING our billing company. All credit
card processing is carried out by FASTSPRING.

Simpris does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And
visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may
prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

Simpris may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Simpris may display this
information publicly or provide it to others. However, Simpris does not disclose personallyidentifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Simpris discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to
those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
information in order to process it on Simpris's behalf or to provide services available at Simpris's
websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors
and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Simpris's
websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Simpris will not rent or sell
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Simpris discloses potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
order or other governmental request, or when Simpris believes in good faith that disclosure is
reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Simpris, third parties or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of a Simpris website and have supplied your email address, Simpris may
occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you
up to date with what's going on with Simpris and our products. If you send us a request (for example
via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Simpris takes all
measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's
browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Simpris uses cookies to help Simpris
identify and track visitors, their usage of Simpris's website, and their website access preferences.
Simpris visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their
browsers to refuse cookies before using Simpris's websites, with the drawback that certain features
of Simpris's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If Simpris, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Simpris goes
out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred
or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer
of Simpris may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Third-party content

Third-party content appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by partners, who
may set cookies. These cookies allow the partner to recognize your computer each time you interact
with the content to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This Privacy
Policy covers the use of cookies by Simpris and does not cover the use of cookies by any partners.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Simpris may change its Privacy Policy from time to
time, and in Simpris's sole discretion. Simpris encourages visitors to frequently check this page for
any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy
Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
