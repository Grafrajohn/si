## Overview of program management
Program management is managing a program which consists of several related projects, and often where the completion of the projects achieves an overall program aim.

Programs may spread across several disciplines for example when developing a new product, which may involve engineering, logistics, marketing, supply chain, manufacturing and others.

It is advised to group projects into a program when some of the following conditions are met:

together a group of projects are part of an overall strategy
there are advantages to grouping the projects together
direction by senior management would be advantageous
where the nature of the projects is that there is advantage to managing them as a program
Programs can be diven by strategy, vision, compliance or the need for rationalisation of project management.

Some methodologies for program management state that there are seven principles of programs as follows:

### Alignment with organisational strategy
The program should be aligned with the strategy of the organisation

### Strategic purpose
The program should have a staregic purpose which requires high level management

### Supporting a vision
Programs are well suited to supporting major change guided by a vision. This may involve activities such as preparation, planning, reorganisation, communication and alteration of the thinking of employees

### Focus on benefits of realisation of program
The program enables an overall focus on the various activities within it and their benefits to the organisation

### Cross activity coherence
The program may feature a number of projects where cros project consistency is required

### Leveraging the organisational knowledge base
Staff working within the program may have complimentry skills which can assist in overall delivery

### Adding organisational value
The program may be able to reduce overall costs by grouping together projects which have similarities and where there might be overlap, or or where one set of staff expertise could serve several programs.
