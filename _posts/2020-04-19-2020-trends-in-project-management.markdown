The most immediate current trend in project management, during the Covid-19 pandemic, is to stay well, stay in work and do everything you can to ensure that your company and clients stay in business.

Having said the above we can now look at the non-pandemic trends in project management for 2020.

## Artificial Intelligence

Ever since HAL messed things up in '2001 A Space Odyssey' we have awaited the arrival of AI with trepidation. If project managers still have jobs, and it didn't work out too well in the aforenamed movie, then how will AI affect their profession? At Simpris we think that AI will be able to check projects for integrity; for example to ensure that stakeholders have seen important changes, or that project managers are warned when the slow progress of tasks endangers project milestones and deadlines. With AI constantly checking the minutiae of a project, the idea is that project managers can concentrate on bigger things.

## Converging project management methodologies

The Monty Python comedian Eric Idle once said that there were many religions each of which claimed a monopoly on the truth. But they could not all be right. Likewise there are so many project management methodologies that one wonders if they can all be right. Perhaps we could merge in the best ideas from all of the methodologies, in a sort of project management dialectic, where out of the fusion of many methodologies comes a fuller and better methodology incorporating the best of each. For example some of the structure of the PRINCE methodology with the responsiveness and light weight of the agile methodologies. A more structured agile approach? There are sings that this is already happening.
