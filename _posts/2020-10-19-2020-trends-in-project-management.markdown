The most immediate current trend in project management, during the Covid-19 pandemic, is to stay well, stay in work and do everything you can to ensure that your company and clients stay in business.

Having said the above we can now look at the non-pandemic trends in project management for 2020.

## Artificial Intelligence

Ever since HAL messed things up in '2001 A Space Odyssey' we have awaited the arrival of AI with trepidation. If project managers still have jobs, and it didn't work out too well in the afore named movie, then how will AI affect their profession? At Simpris we think that AI will be able to check projects for integrity; for example to ensure that stakeholders have seen important changes, or that project managers are warned when the slow progress of tasks threatens to endanger project milestones and deadlines. With AI constantly checking the minutiae of a project, the idea is that project managers can concentrate on bigger things.

### Risk and AI

It is clear that the risk factors in a project could be assessed by AI from information given by the project managers. For example a large and complex project would be expected to carry more risks. AI could check for such projects where the risks identified seemed to be unduly low in number. AI could look for words or phrases in project information which are identified with inherently higher risks such as healthcare terminology. AI could also check that evaluation of risk has been signed off by authoritative personnel and that these personnel also regularly review risk as part of risk control. AI can also recalculate risk metrics according to the risk management framework used. 

### Budget 

AI excels at predictions from a set of numbers, and could examine progress against estimates so far to predict budget overruns. On a broader level AI could also examine programmes to spot trends in budgetary underperformance and predict future project overruns.

### Time

By processing past project information AI could estimate the time required for future projects taking into account the amount of work required, those performing the work and the nature of the work. AI could advise programme managers from its analysis of pas experience in terms of time spent.

## Converging project management methodologies

The Monty Python comedian Eric Idle once said that there were many religions each of which claimed a monopoly on the truth. But they could not all be right. Likewise there are so many project management methodologies that one wonders if they can all be right. Perhaps we could merge in the best ideas from all of the methodologies, in a sort of project management dialectic, where out of the fusion of many methodologies comes a fuller and better methodology incorporating the best of each. For example some of the structure of the PRINCE methodology with the responsiveness and light weight of the agile methodologies. A more structured agile approach? There are sings that this is already happening.

## More diversity in project teams

Diversity in projects is steadily improving across lines of gender, race and ethnicity. However this improvement is ongoing not fully realised. Particularly senior positions in the project team are still held by people fro narrow backgrounds.

## More visualisation of project data

The quantum leap made by computer displays, even on mobile phones and wristwatches, means that managers and coordinators are used to seeing visualisations of data. Project management data is no different to this. Modern telecommunications, the Internet and real-time databases mean that visualisations can show data for a project is it currently is - and in a form of virtual 3D where viewers can pick a particular node and investigate it in great detail. Visualisations are already big business and will only get bigger. Typical project management visualisations include:

- Gantt charts
- Pie charts
- Line graphs
- RAG (Red Amber Green) diagrams

## Remote and cross border collaboration



## Blockchain security

## Emotional intelligence

## Wellbeing of project staff

## Big data analysis
