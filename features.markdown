Easy to use project management – Simpris simply organises work into 4 levels:
* Programme
* Project
* Tasklist
* Task
This gives Simpris powerful capabilities to organise tasks without over-complicating how it works. Let’s explain the 4 terms above:
## Programme
A programme is the top level of organisation in Simpris. Programmes allow large organisations to run many projects in parallel, where those projects are still part of distinct programmes. But smaller organisations can also use programmes to sort projects into different areas of operations such as Human Resources or Finance.
## Project
The project is the cornerstone of work organisation in Simpris. Virtually everything people do at work is part of some overall project. Building refurbishment, product launch, relocation – this list is endless. By thinking in terms of projects you can easily group work planned and work done under those projects allowing the summarisation of work and effort.
## Tasklist
Tasklists give structure to your projects in Simpris. hence each project is subdivided into as many tasklists as required.
## Task
Finally the task is the basic unit of work in Simpris. Everything comes down to tasks. Eask task is allocated to someone on the project and they update the task with progress made and expected completion date.

The following data is stored against each task:
* name
* description
* status
* priority
* assigned to
* start date
* estimated time
* percent complete
* completion date
* phase to which task belongs
* linked task
