WELCOME TO SIMPRIS’S WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (THE “SERVICE”). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN THE LEGAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT GOVERN YOUR USE, SUBSCRIPTION AND ACCESS OF THE SERVICE.

This Agreement (the “Agreement” or “TOS”) is between Simpris and the Customer as applicable. You are the “Customer” under this Agreement if you by clicking or tapping on a button indicating your acceptance of this Agreement, by executing a document that references this Agreement, or by using the Services. If you are an organization, the individual who agrees to this Agreement on your behalf must have the authority to bind you to this Agreement.

## Services

Support Services. Simpris may need to access your account in order to deliver support and customer services.
Changes to Services. Simpris continually changes and improves the Services. The Customer’s use of any new features and functionality added to the Services may be subject to additional or different terms relating to such new features and functionality. Simpris may alter or remove functionality from the Services at any time without prior notice. Simpris will inform the Customer of any additional or different terms as set out in Section 7.1.
Suspension of Services. Simpris may limit or suspend the Services from time to time at our discretion (for example, to perform scheduled maintenance). If Simpris limits or suspends the Services, we will endeavor to give the Customer reasonable advance notice so that the Customer can plan around it. However, there may be some situations, such as security emergencies, where it may not be practicable for Simpris to give advance notice. Simpris will use commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope and duration of the suspension or limitation as is needed to resolve the issue that prompted such action.

Third Party Services. If the Customer uses any third party service with the Services (including services which use any application programming interface (API) provided by Simpris), the Customer acknowledges that the service may access or use the customer’s information. Simpris will not be responsible for any act or omission of the third party, including such third party’s use of the customer’s information. Simpris does not warrant or support any such third party service, and the Customer should contact that third party for any issues arising from the Customer’s use of the third party service.
