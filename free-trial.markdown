We want potential customers like you to try Simpris and we hope you will like it. So we allow you to get started with a free project management software account. You can just register with us and start managing your first 2 projects without paying a penny and no credit card is required to sign up.

If you decide you like Simpris and want to scale up to manage more projects, then you can choose from one of our great value plans, designed to accomodate teams of all sizes.

## Exceptional value for money
Our customers like the exceptional value for money offered by Simpris, with no hidden extras. Small teams, on our plans for smaller organisations, get the same features as corporations. The only difference is scale.

Unlike some other vendors we do not levy extra charges for certain features. Every customer gets the full feature set.

## Scale as you grow
Hopefully your organisation will grow and prosper. As it does, Simpris has you covered. Some of the worldâ€™s biggest media organisations use the technology on which Simpris is based. Simpris is designed from the ground up to be scalable, which is to say it can grow with you.

Simpris can be run on your own custom server with your own custom security requirements, either hosted in the cloud on your own premises, for large organisations with special requirements .

## Impress your clients with Simpris
Small companies need to impress big clients. Again Simpris has you covered. Agencies and companies with multiple clients can use Simpris, which  is designed for this purpose. Each client is in its own virtual compartment, with its own users, where clients can only see their own data. Therefore with Simpris it is possible for a few staff to manage many projects with many clients.
